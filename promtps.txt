suppose i have an idea of creating a movie library webpage , using html css js .
Now it will be a simple project featuring only one page.

the page will contain:
1. at the top header part will contain :
	1. header : right side will feature a search icon, 
[it will be totally dynamic like , the search icon will be responsive, - on slicking the icon, it will expand into a search field, on typing inside of it , the name of the movie if present as a card on the page, the card will be highlighted , the bakcground border of the card will be highlighted with a border color when search matches, else will show 'no result found' ]
	1. header : left side extreme will feature a circular logo,
this header will be static to the page, that means when scrolling down this header will not move up or down with the page.

2. the entire page will be like a matrix data library like a movie library page, 
it will be responsive like if opened on a smaller display, it can manage itself accordingly and shrik and adjust the movie cards.

like on the desktop mode , if it features : 5 horizontal cards side by side , the cards will be of size suppose '3:4' and will also have a name card attached below it, making around all together the size around '9:16' approximately.
graphically will be like this :

----------     ----------     ----------     ----------     ----------
continues..
the page will have page numbers below of the card as page : 1 , 2 , 3 , ... N.
on clicking the page numbers it will refresh the contents of the cards in the page, and will show the next set of cards.

3. the page will be dynamic hence, if i wanted to update it i can, like later want to add a card , it will be easy to do, 
4. the cards will feature images of the movies like a front card 1 will feature a image , and below it will feature the name of the movie, the images will be stored in a folder which will contain all the images.
5. now , i have a google drive and inside it it has separate folders for each movie , hence on clicking the cards it will redirect to the respective movie folder, this will be the logic behind .
6. Lastly in the footer part, a discalimer and copyright message will be present, then the contact details, and the developer details .
